# Node.js Server Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered in Node.js server development where the server starts but does not respond correctly to client requests.  The `bug.js` file contains the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected version.

## Problem

The server in `bug.js` starts, but incoming requests aren't handled as expected. This can manifest as timeouts or unexpected responses.

## Solution

The solution in `bugSolution.js` addresses the issue by ensuring proper handling of the HTTP response and checking for errors.
